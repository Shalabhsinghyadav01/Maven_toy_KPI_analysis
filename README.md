### Dataset Table  

| **Table Name**            | **Type**               | **Description**  |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **sales.csv**             | CSV File               | Contains transactional sales records, including date, store ID, product ID, and units sold. |

### Data Credibility and Integrity


Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the dataset is paramount for deriving meaningful insights and making data-driven decisions. The dataset used in this analysis originates from Maven Toys’ internal business systems, which track sales transactions, inventory levels, and store performance metrics. To maintain data integrity, multiple verification processes were implemented, including cross-referencing sales records with inventory updates, validating store attributes against official business records, and ensuring product details align with standardized classifications. Additionally, consistency checks were performed to identify and resolve discrepancies, such as missing values, duplicate entries, and anomalies in transactional data. The dataset underwent data cleaning procedures to correct formatting inconsistencies and align date structures for accurate trend analysis. By leveraging reliable data sources and applying rigorous validation methods, the dataset ensures a high level of authenticity, supporting accurate business analysis and strategic decision-making.
## Process Phase
To ensure data accuracy and efficiency in analysis and dashboard creation, Excel and Python were utilized for data preparation. Excel was employed for initial data cleaning, allowing for an intuitive approach to identifying and resolving inconsistencies, while Python provided robust capabilities for advanced data manipulation and integration.

### Data Cleaning
The datasets were first opened in Excel for a preliminary review, enabling the identification of missing values and formatting inconsistencies. Null values were systematically addressed—irrelevant missing data was removed to maintain dataset integrity, while necessary null values, such as those in the “Stock in Hand” column, were replaced with 0 to prevent misinterpretation during analysis.

### Duplicate Handling

Duplicate records were identified and removed to prevent skewed results. Rather than relying on a single-column check (such as Product ID, which may naturally repeat for different stores), comparisons were conducted across multiple columns to ensure duplicate detection was accurate and did not mistakenly remove legitimate data entries.

### Data Merging

Once the cleaned datasets were finalized, Python was used to merge them into a single consolidated CSV file, facilitating seamless data analysis and visualization. This integration step ensured that sales, inventory, product, and store information were aligned efficiently, enabling comprehensive insights for strategic decision-making.

**Python Code for Merging Datasets**  
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load datasets
sales_df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")       # Sales transaction data
products_df = pd.read_csv("products.csv") # Product details
inventory_df = pd.read_csv("inventory.csv") # Inventory levels
stores_df = pd.read_csv("stores.csv")     # Store location details
calendar_df = pd.read_csv("calendar.csv") # Date-related attributes

# Merge sales data with product details using 'Product_ID' as the key
sales_products_df = sales_df.merge(products_df, on="Product_ID", how="left")

# Merge the result with store details using 'Store_ID' as the key
sales_products_stores_df = sales_products_df.merge(stores_df, on="Store_ID", how="left")

# Merge with inventory data to include stock levels
sales_products_stores_inventory_df = sales_products_stores_df.merge(inventory_df, on=["Store_ID", "Product_ID"], how="left")

# Merge with calendar data to add date-based attributes
final_merged_df = sales_products_stores_inventory_df.merge(calendar_df, on="Date", how="left")

# Save the final merged dataset to a new CSV file
final_merged_df.to_csv("merged_dataset.csv", index=False)

# Print confirmation message
print("Datasets successfully merged and saved as 'merged_dataset.csv'.")
```
Usage Notes
- Ensure all datasets (sales.csv, products.csv, inventory.csv, stores.csv, calendar.csv) are in the same directory as the script.
- Modify the on parameter in merge() if column names differ in your dataset.
- The "left" join ensures that all sales records are retained, even if some corresponding details are missing.

## Analyze and Share Phase

### **1️⃣ What are the top-performing products in terms of sales?**  
```SQL
select Product_Name , sum(Units) as Total_sales
from `1.maven_toy_data`
group by Product_Name
order by Total_sales desc
LIMIT 5;
```
 - **Colorbuds** led sales with **104,368 units sold**, followed by **PlayDoh Can (103,128 units)** and **Barrel O’ Slime (91,663 units)**.  
- These products represent **high-demand items** and should be prioritized for restocking and promotional strategies.  
- Bundling strategies can be explored, especially for frequently bought-together items identified in the basket analysis.

```SQL
select Product_Name , count(*) as stock_instance
from `1.maven_toy_data`
where Stock_On_Hand = 0
group by Product_Name
order by stock_instance desc
limit 5 :
```
 - **Action Figure (5,035 stockouts)** and **Hot Wheels 5-Pack (4,853 stockouts)** were the most frequently unavailable products.  
- Persistent stock shortages indicate **supply chain inefficiencies**, requiring improved demand forecasting and supplier coordination.  
- Implementing automated stock alerts and supplier agreements can help **minimize lost sales** due to stockouts.  

### **3️⃣ Which store locations generate the highest revenue?**  

```SQL
select Store_Location , sum(Product_Price*Units) as Total_sales
from `1.maven_toy_data`
group by Store_Location
order by Total_sales desc;
```
- **Downtown stores generated the highest revenue ($8.2M),** significantly outperforming other locations.

group by Product_Category
order by total_stock desc
limit 5 ; 
```
- **Art & Crafts (6.5M units) and Games (5.5M units) held the most excess inventory**, leading to high holding costs.  
- Overstocked items should be **targeted for promotional campaigns or bundled with high-demand products** to improve turnover.  
- Dynamic discounting models can be implemented to **gradually clear excess stock without heavy markdown losses**.  

### **5️⃣ Which products were frequently bought together?**
```SQL
select a.Product_Name as product_a , b.Product_Name as product_b,count(*) as frequency
from `1.maven_toy_data` a 
join `1.maven_toy_data` b 
on a.Sale_ID = b.Sale_ID and a.Product_ID <> b.Product_ID
group by product_a , product_b
order by frequency desc
limit 5;

```

## **7. Conclusion (Act Phase)**  

The analysis of Maven Toys' sales, inventory, and store performance has provided valuable insights into key areas for business optimization. By leveraging data-driven strategies, the company can improve its operational efficiency, enhance product availability, and drive revenue growth. Below are the key findings and actionable recommendations based on the data analysis.  

---

### **Findings and Recommendations**  

| **Recommendation** | **Description** |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **1. Optimizing Stock for Best-Selling Products** | High-demand products such as Colorbuds, PlayDoh Can, and Barrel O’ Slime frequently sell out, leading to missed sales opportunities. Maven Toys should improve demand forecasting and prioritize stock replenishment for these products to maximize revenue potential. |
| **2. Addressing Frequent Stockouts** | Items such as Action Figures and Hot Wheels 5-Pack experience persistent stock shortages, indicating inefficiencies in supply chain planning. Implementing automated stock alerts and strengthening supplier coordination can help prevent inventory gaps. |
| **3. Enhancing Store-Specific Strategies** | Downtown stores generate the highest revenue, while airport stores underperform. Expanding in high-traffic areas and adjusting product selections in low-performing locations can improve profitability. |
| **4. Managing Overstocked Inventory** | Overstocked categories, such as Art & Crafts and Games, lead to high holding costs. Targeted clearance sales, dynamic discounting, and bundling with high-demand products can improve inventory turnover. |
| **5. Leveraging Basket Analysis for Cross-Selling** | Frequently bought-together products, such as PlayDoh Can and Colorbuds, present opportunities for bundle promotions. Implementing targeted product pairings and discounts can increase basket size and enhance customer engagement. |
